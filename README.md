### Description
Custom ROMs often don't include the Google ringtones/notifications/system sounds and bootanimation, instead including numerous, terrible sounds and often less-than-desirable visuals. This zip installs the Nexus media for recently-retired Nexus devices, using the zip name (also reading from /data/.nexusmedia) to allow user choice, systemlessly installed (SuperSU and Magisk supported) or with an addon.d script to survive a ROM update or dirty flash.

Contains hammerhead, flo/deb, shamu and volantis/volantisg media, reading the zip filename for "hammerhead", "flo" or "deb", "shamu", "volantis" or "volantisg" to choose (defaulting to hammerhead).

Please read the [release post](https://forum.xda-developers.com/showpost.php?p=69978402&postcount=1021) for further information about zip renaming and special features.

### Notes
Magisk module version is populated at flash time by the chosen media's device name
